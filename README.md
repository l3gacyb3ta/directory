# directory
A directory of Folk systems

## To add a new directory:
Make a PR creating:
- a folder in the root of the project with the hostname of your system (e.g. `folk0`, `folk-convivial`)
  - Within the folder make a minimum an `index.md` page with:
    - `## System name` (required)
    - `## City` (encouraged)
    - `## System setup` (required, at least one photo or video of your system)
    - `##Program gallery` (encouraged, not necessary for your inital system addition PR)
      - In here you'll link to documentation in sub-pages for individual programs you'd like to share that you've created in your system
      - e.g. for `folk0` we want to share the _Metrics_ program so I'll create a page at `directory/folk0/metrics/index.md` and link `./metrics/index.html` in the `folk0` program gallery bullet list
    - `media`
      - Create a folder in your system's folder called `media` as a place to put, at minimum, an image or your system running.
      - You can also put other example images in here in order to link them from your program gallery posts
